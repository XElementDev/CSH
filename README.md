# Cloud Sync Helper
A Windows client that enables synchronization of save games and settings for a bunch of applications, resp. games.

## Usage
For using the Cloud Sync Helper application no installation is required. Simply download the latest binaries from the GitHub releases site [1].

To always have the latest version, just add the shared folder [2] to your Google Drive. Every new version will be put to that folder, which will be automatically synced by your Google Drive client.

**Currently the application is not yet released, so it is highly recommened *not* to use the binaries from Google Drive. It most likely won't work properly for you, yet.**
